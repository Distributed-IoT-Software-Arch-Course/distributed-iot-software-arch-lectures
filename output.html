<pre><code>The students of Carnegie Mellon University invent the ARPANET-connected coke machine. Four students from the School of Computer Science department installed the switches in the coke machine. They counted how many coke bottles had remained in each row and for how long. If the loaded bottle spends a long time in the machine, it is labeled “cold”. All this data was then remotely available to customers via a finger interface. This experiment had inspired a lot of inventors all over the world to create their own connected appliances.</code></pre>

<h1 id="cyberphysical-system--distributed-software">Cyber–Physical
System- Distributed Software</h1>
<p>Integration of Physical and Digital Components: CPS involves the
integration of software systems with physical components such as
sensors, actuators, and control systems. The software must interact with
these physical elements to monitor and control the underlying physical
processes. Real-Time and Predictability: CPS often operates in real-time
or near-real-time environments where timely and predictable responses
are critical. The software must be designed to meet stringent timing
requirements, ensuring timely data collection, processing, and control
actions. Heterogeneity and Interoperability: CPS typically involve a mix
of diverse technologies, devices, and communication protocols. The
software must be capable of interacting and integrating with different
hardware and software components, ensuring interoperability and seamless
communication among them. Safety and Reliability: CPS are often deployed
in safety-critical domains such as automotive, healthcare, and
industrial automation. The software must be developed with a strong
emphasis on safety and reliability, adhering to rigorous standards and
employing techniques like fault tolerance and error handling. 19</p>
<!-- Slide number: 20 -->
<h1 id="cyberphysical-system--distributed-software-1">Cyber–Physical
System- Distributed Software</h1>
<p>Scalability and Adaptability: CPS are often deployed in large-scale
systems where the number of connected devices and data volumes can be
substantial. The software must be scalable, capable of handling
increasing system complexity and data loads. Additionally, it should be
adaptable to dynamic changes in the environment or system requirements.
Network and Connectivity: CPS software must utilize the network
connectivity for communication between the cyber and physical world, as
well as among different CPS components. For example, a smart grid system
must coordinate the power generation and distribution among different
sources and consumers through the internet. Security and Privacy: CPS
are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats due to their interconnected
nature. The software must incorporate robust security measures to
protect against potential attacks and ensure the privacy and integrity
of sensitive data. Verification and Validation: Due to the critical
nature of CPS, software development for CPS requires thorough
verification and validation processes. Rigorous testing, simulation, and
formal methods are employed to ensure the correctness, performance, and
safety of the software 20</p>

<h1 id="cyberphysical-system-open-issues">Cyber–Physical System Open
Issues</h1>
<p>If we escalate to the more general Cyber-Physical System models, the
design and control challenges become even harder, since individual
component autonomy must be glued by explicitly addressing
interdependence and coordination, interoperability, distributed control
and emergence of behaviors In this context centralized and static
management and control model are not expected to be the right solution
approach to address all these challenges and the current main existing
issues are the following: Centralized and monolithic Software
architectures Missing management of the massive heterogeneity and
fragmentation of the physical layer (protocols, software, hardware, data
format, etc …) Limited interoperability and collaboration both between
existing solutions and through cross-domain application scenarios
Centralized learning and coordination 21</p>

<h1 id="cyberphysical-system-of-systems">Cyber–Physical System of
Systems</h1>
<p>The concept of Cyber-Physical System of Systems (CPSoS) refers to the
integration and collaboration of multiple interconnected CPSs to create
a more complex and sophisticated system CPSoS is characterized by the
coordination and interaction of individual CPS units, each with its own
set of physical components, computational elements, and networked
communication. In a CPSoS, the individual CPS units retain their
autonomy and functionality while working together towards a common goal
or objective. These systems can vary in scale and complexity, ranging
from localized collaborations to large-scale networks of interconnected
CPS units The key idea behind CPSoS is to leverage the capabilities and
resources of multiple CPS units to achieve enhanced performance,
efficiency, and functionality that would not be possible with isolated
systems. By combining the individual strengths of different CPS units,
CPSoS can offer improved system-wide intelligence, resilience, and
adaptability. 23</p>
<!-- Slide number: 24 -->
<h1 id="cyberphysical-system-of-systems-1">Cyber–Physical System of
Systems</h1>
<p>CPSoS can be found in various domains, such as smart cities,
transportation systems, industrial automation, and healthcare. Examples
include: interconnected traffic management systems coordinated smart
grid networks integrated healthcare monitoring systems smart
manufacturing However, managing CPSoS presents several challenges:
ensuring interoperability and seamless communication between different
CPS units handling heterogeneity in system architectures and
technologies addressing issues of scalability and complexity managing
security and privacy concerns across the interconnected systems.
Overall, CPSoS represents a higher-level integration of multiple CPS
units, enabling collaborative and coordinated operation to achieve more
advanced functionalities, improved performance, and increased system
intelligence. 24</p>

<h1 id="cpsos-smart-manufacturing-example">CPSoS – Smart Manufacturing
Example</h1>
<p>For example, in a Smart Manufacturing use case In this scenario,
various interconnected CPS units collaborate to optimize production
processes, monitor equipment health, and improve overall efficiency. The
CPSoS in a smart manufacturing system typically includes multiple CPS
components such as: Industrial Robots: Robotic arms and automation
systems that perform tasks like assembly, welding, or material handling.
Internet of Things Devices: Sensors and actuators embedded in machinery,
equipment, and production lines to collect real-time data on parameters
like temperature, pressure, vibration, and energy consumption.
Industrial Control Systems: Distributed control systems and Programmable
Logic Controllers (PLCs) that regulate and coordinate operations across
different CPS units. Data Analytics and AI Systems: Machine learning
algorithms and data analytics tools that process the collected data,
identify patterns, and provide insights for predictive maintenance,
quality control, and optimization. Supply Chain Management Systems: CPS
units involved in the coordination and optimization of supply chain
activities, including inventory management, demand forecasting, and
logistics. Human-Machine Interfaces: Interfaces that allow human
operators to monitor and control the manufacturing processes, providing
real-time feedback and facilitating human-machine collaboration. 27</p>
<!-- Slide number: 28 -->
<h1 id="cpsos-smart-manufacturing-example-1">CPSoS – Smart Manufacturing
Example</h1>
<p>These interconnected CPS units collaborate to achieve various
objectives, such as: Optimizing production schedules based on demand
forecasts and real-time data on equipment performance. Implementing
predictive maintenance strategies by monitoring equipment health in
real-time and identifying potential failures before they occur.
Optimizing energy consumption and resource utilization by leveraging
real-time data on energy usage and production demands. Enabling
real-time quality control through continuous monitoring and feedback on
product quality parameters. Facilitating flexible and adaptive
production processes by dynamically reconfiguring CPS units based on
changing demands or resource availability. In such scenario, the CPSoS
in smart manufacturing systems improves efficiency, productivity, and
quality by leveraging the integration and collaboration of multiple CPS
units. It enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of
manufacturing processes, resulting in enhanced operational performance
and competitiveness in the industrial ecosystem. 28</p>

<h1 id="iot-vs-wireless-sensor-networks">IoT vs Wireless Sensor
Networks</h1>
<p>Wireless Ad-hoc Sensor Networks (WSN) represent the ancestors of the
Internet of Things without a common and shared IP network. WSNs promised
wide support of the interaction between people and their surroundings.
The potential of the WSN lies in the three words composing the acronym
itself: Wireless: puts the focus on the freedom that the elimination of
wires gives in terms of mobility support and ease of system deployment
Sensor: reflects the capability of sensing technology to provide the
means to perceive and interact – in a wide sense – with the world
Networks: gives emphasis to the possibility of building systems whose
functional capabilities are given by a plurality of communicating
devices, possibly distributed over large areas. 38</p>

<p>Telemetry allows the possibility to collect remote measurements from
the field Telemetry can be associated to: Long-range Measurements:
temperature, humidity, wind from remote weather stations (cellular
network or Inmarsat satellite network); Formula 1 Short-range
Measurements: pacemaker (telemetry coil, to measure the activity without
surgery: low-power communication) M2M is a generalization of telemetry,
which implies autonomic bidirectional communication between non-human
operated machines and a central collector device</p>

<h1 id="m2m-fragmentation">M2M Fragmentation</h1>
<p>Fragmented industry verticals: most industries are solving their M2M
needs on their own; Often converging upon similar architectures and
elements; the M2M “wheel” is reinvented from industry to industry
Customized solutions abound: since solutions are on an
industry-by-industry basis, each solution requires its own design,
production, and implementation cycle; unique solutions often result in
sole-sourcing of customized hardware; software design is limited to a
small group of developers who understand the architecture and API’s for
a particular industry or platform, thus leading to high development
costs and high costs for support. Lack of scale for components:
economies of scale are difficult to achieve in any given industry since
solutions are so varied and unique. 40</p>

<h1 id="iot-software-key-characteristics">IoT Software – Key
Characteristics</h1>
<p>There are certain shared characteristics that should be embraced by
every IoT stack, including: Loosely Coupled: Each IoT stack should have
the ability to function independently of other stacks. It should be
possible to utilize an IoT Cloud Platform from one provider, an IoT
gateway from another provider, and a device stack from a third provider,
enabling flexibility and interoperability. Modular: Each stack should
allow for the selection and integration of features from different
suppliers. This modular approach facilitates customization and the
ability to choose components that best fit the specific IoT solution
requirements. Platform-Independent: Each stack should be agnostic to the
underlying hardware and cloud infrastructure. For example, the device
stack should be compatible with multiple microcontrollers (MCUs), while
the IoT Cloud Platform should be adaptable to different Cloud Platform
as a Service (PaaS) offerings. Based on Open Standards: Communication
between the stacks should be based on open standards, ensuring
interoperability and compatibility across different IoT components. Open
standards foster collaboration and the creation of ecosystems that
promote seamless integration. Defined APIs: Each stack should provide
well-defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable easy
integration with existing applications and facilitate interoperability
with other IoT solutions. These APIs simplify the development and
integration processes, promoting efficient connectivity and data
exchange.</p>
