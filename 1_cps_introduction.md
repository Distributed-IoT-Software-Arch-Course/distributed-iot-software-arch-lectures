# The Internet of Things (IoT) Evolution & Revolution

In the context of the mobile revolution, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative concept that envisions a world where everyday objects are connected to the internet, enabling them to collect and exchange data. The IoT represents a significant evolution in the way we interact with technology, 
as it extends connectivity beyond traditional computing devices to encompass a wide range of physical objects and environments.

> 🔍 The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the idea of a network of networks with billions of uniquely identified physical devices
> denoted also as **Smart Objects** organized in an **Internet-like structure**.
> Smart Objects are items such as sensors, consumer devices, and enterprise assets that are **connected to both the Internet and each other**.

![IoT Pillars](images/Lecture1/iot_pillars.png)

**Figure 1.8:** IoT Pillars - Communication Technologies (e.g., LoRa, NB-IoT), Hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino), Software (e.g., C/C++, Python, Linux, RTOS) and Protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP)

One of the **key characteristics of the Internet of Things (IoT)** is its reliance on the **Internet** itself. 
The IoT is not simply about connecting devices; it is about connecting them **using standard Internet protocols**, rather than proprietary solutions. This approach is **crucial for achieving scalability, interoperability, and global accessibility** in IoT systems.

At the core of IoT connectivity is the **Internet Protocol (IP)**, which provides a **universal and standardized method for devices to communicate and exchange data** across networks. 
Devices that join an IoT network are **directly or indirectly connected to an IP network**, allowing them to be **addressed, managed, and integrated using standard IP-based protocols**.
By leveraging **IP as a common protocol**, IoT devices can not only communicate with each other, but also **connect seamlessly to the broader Internet and cloud services**. This enables **new opportunities for data storage, processing, and analysis**, and supports the development of **innovative applications and services** on a global scale.

A key element to consider it that being connected to the Internet is not mandatory for all the devices, but they must be able to communicate using IP protocols, even if they are connected to a local network that is not directly connected to the Internet.
We can have IoT deployments that are fully connected to the Internet, partially connected, or even completely isolated from it, depending on the specific use case and requirements.
The common factor is that the devices must be able to communicate using IP protocols, regardless of their connectivity to the broader Internet.

![](images/Lecture1/iot_stack.png)

**Figure 1.9:** IoT Protocol Stack vs Traditional Networking Stack

IoT device cannot always use the traditional Internet protocol stack due to their **resource constraints** (e.g., limited processing power, memory, and energy).
For this reason, IoT devices often use **lightweight protocols** that are specifically designed for resource-constrained environments. 
These protocols are optimized for low power consumption, reduced bandwidth usage, and efficient data transmission.

For example, two widely adopted protocols in IoT applications are **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)** and **CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)**. 

- **MQTT** is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for efficient communication between devices with limited bandwidth and resources. It is commonly used for telemetry and remote monitoring in IoT scenarios. MQTT can be compared to traditional enterprise messaging protocols such as **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)**, as both support the publish-subscribe paradigm, but MQTT is optimized for constrained environments.

- **CoAP** is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with resource-constrained devices and networks. It follows a request/response model similar to **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**, but is much more lightweight, making it suitable for IoT deployments where minimizing overhead is critical.

These protocols are specifically engineered to be lightweight and efficient, addressing the limitations of IoT devices in terms of processing power, memory, and energy consumption. In contrast, traditional protocols like HTTP and **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** are more resource-intensive and may not be practical for all IoT scenarios.

The **adoption of standard Internet protocols**—such as **IP, TCP, UDP, and HTTP**—along with 
the use of **lightweight alternatives** like **MQTT** and **CoAP**, is **essential** for the successful 
implementation and widespread adoption of IoT systems. By leveraging these protocols,
**IoT devices can achieve seamless connectivity, interoperability, and scalability**, enabling a wide range of applications 
and services that enhance our daily lives and transform various industries.

For example, **smart home devices** (e.g., thermostats, lights, and security cameras) use standard protocols 
to communicate with mobile apps and cloud platforms, allowing users to monitor and control their homes remotely. 
In **industrial IoT**, sensors and machines use MQTT to transmit telemetry data to centralized dashboards 
for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. **Healthcare wearables** leverage CoAP to efficiently 
send patient data to hospital systems for continuous health tracking.

Furthermore, the use of **standard Internet protocols facilitates the integration of IoT devices with existing IT infrastructure and cloud services**, 
enabling new opportunities for **data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence**. 
For instance, IoT sensors in agriculture can use lightweight protocols like MQTT to efficiently transmit environmental data—such as soil moisture, 
temperature, and humidity—to cloud-based analytics platforms. MQTT optimizes communication between resource-constrained devices and the cloud 
by enabling reliable, low-bandwidth data transfer. Once collected, this data can be exposed via HTTP APIs, 
making it accessible to traditional applications such as dashboards for real-time monitoring or AI models for advanced analytics. 
This seamless integration of IoT protocols and standard web technologies enables organizations 
to build smarter, more responsive, and data-driven solutions across domains.

- **Machine-to-Machine (M2M)** communication generalizes telemetry by supporting **autonomic**, **bidirectional** data exchange between non-human-operated machines and central collector systems.
    - **Autonomous operation:** Devices communicate and coordinate actions without manual input.
    - **Bidirectional communication:** Information flows both from field devices to central systems and vice versa, enabling remote control, configuration, and updates.

---

## M2M Fragmentation

The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) landscape is marked by significant fragmentation and lack of standardization across industry verticals. 
This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, increased costs, and limited scalability, as each sector tends to develop 
its own bespoke solutions rather than leveraging common architectures and reusable components.

**Key challenges of M2M fragmentation include:**

- **Industry-Specific Solutions:** Most industries address their M2M requirements independently, often converging on similar architectures and elements but rarely sharing solutions. As a result, the "M2M wheel" is repeatedly reinvented from one sector to another.
- **Customization Overload:** Solutions are typically designed, produced, and implemented on an industry-by-industry basis. This leads to unique, customized hardware and software, often resulting in sole-sourcing and vendor lock-in.
- **Limited Developer Ecosystem:** Software development is restricted to small groups of experts familiar with the specific architecture and APIs of each platform, driving up development and support costs.
- **Poor Economies of Scale:** The diversity and uniqueness of solutions make it difficult to achieve economies of scale for components, resulting in higher costs and slower innovation.

As illustrated in the figure above, CPS typically involve the following phases:

1. **Perceive**: In this phase, sensors collect data from the physical environment, such as temperature, pressure, or motion.
2. **Process**: The collected data is then processed and analyzed using computational algorithms to extract meaningful insights and patterns. This phase can be further broken down into sub-phases:
   - **Analyze**: The collected data is then processed and analyzed using computational algorithms to extract meaningful insights and patterns.
   - **Learn**: Learning techniques may be applied to enable the system to learn from historical data and improve its performance over time.
   - **Plan**: Based on the analysis and learning, the system can plan actions or responses to be taken in the physical environment.
3. **Act**: Finally, actuators are used to execute the planned actions, such as adjusting a thermostat, controlling a robotic arm, or activating an alarm. 

**Note:** After the action phase, the cycle continues with the system continuously perceiving, analyzing, learning, planning, and acting in a dynamic and adaptive manner.

### CPS Software as Distributed Software

One of the main characteristics of CPS is that each component is characterized by its own software module that is responsible for the management of the component itself. When multiple components are integrated into a CPS, the software modules of each component need to interact and communicate with each other to enable the overall functionality of the system and we start talking about **Distributed Systems** and **Distributed Software**.

![CPS Distributed Software](images/Lecture1/cps_distributed_software.png)

Some of the main challenges and characteristics of CPS software include:

- **Integration of Physical and Digital Components:** CPS involves the integration of software systems with physical components such as sensors, actuators, and control systems. The software must interact with these physical elements to monitor and control the underlying physical processes.
- **Real-Time and Predictability:** CPS often operates in real-time or near-real-time environments where timely and predictable responses are critical. The software must be designed to meet stringent timing requirements, ensuring timely data collection, processing, and control actions.
- **Heterogeneity and Interoperability:** CPS typically involve a mix of diverse technologies, devices, and communication protocols. The software must be capable of interacting and integrating with different hardware and software components, ensuring interoperability and seamless communication among them.
- **Safety and Reliability:** CPS are often deployed in safety-critical domains such as automotive, healthcare, and industrial automation. The software must be developed with a strong emphasis on safety and reliability, adhering to rigorous standards and employing techniques like fault tolerance and error handling.
- **Scalability and Adaptability:** CPS are often deployed in large-scale systems where the number of connected devices and data volumes can be substantial. The software must be scalable, capable of handling increasing system complexity and data loads. Additionally, it should be adaptable to dynamic changes in the environment or system requirements.
- **Network and Connectivity:** CPS software must utilize the network connectivity for communication between the cyber and physical world, as well as among different CPS components. For example, a smart grid system must coordinate the power generation and distribution among different sources and consumers through the internet.
- **Security and Privacy:** CPS are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats due to their interconnected nature. The software must incorporate robust security measures to protect against potential attacks and ensure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.
- **Verification and Validation:** Due to the critical nature of CPS, software development for CPS requires thorough verification and validation processes. Rigorous testing, simulation, and formal methods are employed to ensure the correctness, performance, and safety of the software.

If we escalate to the more general Cyber-Physical System models, the design and control challenges become even harder, since individual component autonomy must be glued by explicitly addressing interdependence and coordination, interoperability, distributed control and emergence of behaviors. In this context centralized and static management and control model are not expected to be the right solution approach to address all these challenges and the current main existing issues are the following: 

- **Centralized** and **monolithic** Software architectures
- Missing management of the **massive heterogeneity** and **fragmentation** of the physical layer (protocols, software, hardware, data format, etc …) 
- **Limited interoperability** and collaboration both between existing solutions and through cross-domain application scenarios 
- **Centralized learning** and coordination

On the other hand, the envisioned goal is to build a new generation of distributed, highly-dynamic, opportunistic, able to operate in an open and coordinated environment through:

- **distributed** and **continuum** architectures (across device, edge, cloud)
- **networking** and **intelligent communication**
- **effective management** of the physical layer heterogeneity
- **standardization** and **native interoperability**
- **control**, **supervision** and **management**
- **local coordination**
- **autonomy** of the sub-systems
- **native system re-configuration**
- **decentralized learning** & **dynamic evolution** and **behaviors**

## From CPS to CPSoS (Cyber-Physical System of Systems)

![Cyber-Physical System of Systems](images/Lecture1/cps_of_systems.png)

The concept of **Cyber-Physical System of Systems (CPSoS)** refers to the **integration** and **collaboration** of multiple, interconnected **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)** to form a more complex and sophisticated system. In a CPSoS, each individual CPS maintains its **autonomy** and **functionality**, yet participates in **coordinated interaction** and **networked communication** with other CPS units to achieve shared objectives.

A **CPSoS** is characterized by:
- **Distributed Coordination:** Multiple CPS units interact and cooperate, leveraging their individual capabilities to address system-wide goals.
- **Autonomous Components:** Each CPS unit operates independently, with its own physical components, computational resources, and control logic.
- **Scalability and Complexity:** CPSoS can range from small, localized collaborations to vast, large-scale networks of CPS units.
- **Enhanced System Intelligence:** By combining the strengths and resources of diverse CPS units, CPSoS enables improved **performance**, **efficiency**, and **adaptability** beyond what isolated systems can achieve.
- **Resilience and Flexibility:** The distributed nature of CPSoS fosters greater **system-wide resilience**, allowing for dynamic adaptation and robust operation even in the face of failures or changing environments.

The key idea behind **CPSoS** is to create a **synergistic network** where the **collective intelligence** and **resources** of multiple CPS units result in superior functionality, adaptability, and reliability, paving the way for advanced applications in domains such as smart cities, industrial automation, healthcare, and transportation.

CPSoS are increasingly prevalent across diverse domains, including smart cities, transportation, industrial automation, and healthcare. **Key examples** of CPSoS include:

Of course, managing CPSoS introduces significant challenges such as:

- **Interoperability:** Achieving seamless communication and data exchange between heterogeneous CPS units
- **Heterogeneity:** Integrating systems with diverse architectures, protocols, and technologies
- **Scalability and Complexity:** Coordinating large numbers of autonomous CPS units while maintaining system performance
- **Security and Privacy:** Protecting sensitive data and ensuring robust operation across interconnected systems

In summary, CPSoS represent a higher-level integration 
of multiple CPS units, enabling collaborative and coordinated operation. 
This approach unlocks advanced functionalities, improved performance, 
and increased system intelligence, but requires addressing interoperability, 
scalability, and security challenges.
