<p>The original idea of the Internet was to connect computers, but very
soon, the idea of connecting other devices to the network emerged. The
image above shows a representation of the ARPANET network in 1978, where
we can see various types of devices connected to the network such as
mainframe computers, minicomputers, and terminals through different
geographical locations such as universities, research institutions, and
government agencies involving multiple countries and satellite
links.</p>

<h2 id="where-are-we-today">Where are we today ?</h2>
<p>Today, the Internet and the Web have evolved far beyond their
original purpose of connecting a handful of computers. They now
interconnect billions of devices worldwide—including smartphones,
tablets, sensors, vehicles, appliances, and industrial machines—across
every continent. This massive global network enables seamless
communication, collaboration, and data exchange at unprecedented
scale.</p>
<p>The exponential growth in connected devices has led to an explosion
in the volume of data generated, transmitted, and processed every
second. Modern Internet infrastructure supports vast amounts of
real-time information, multimedia content, and interactive services.
Cloud computing, edge computing, and advanced networking technologies
have made it possible to deliver rich digital experiences, from social
media and streaming platforms to e-commerce, smart cities, and
industrial automation.</p>
<p>As a result, the Internet has become the backbone for countless
services and applications, powering innovation and transforming how we
live, work, and interact. The availability of massive data volumes and
intelligent services continues to drive new opportunities and challenges
in connectivity, security, and digital transformation.</p>

<h2 id="the-mobile-centric-world">The Mobile Centric World</h2>
<p>The mobile revolution is changing the way we live, work, and
interact. Mobile devices have become an integral part of our daily
lives, enabling us to stay connected, access information, and perform
various tasks on the go. The proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and
wearable devices has transformed communication, entertainment, and
productivity, making it easier than ever to stay connected to the world
around us.</p>
<p>In the picture below, you can see how the mobile revolution has
transformed St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City. The left image from 2005
shows a traditional gathering of people, while the right image from 2013

<p>This image hides an interesting aspect on what we are not seeing and
able to support this massive number of mobile devices. The answer is the
<strong>Network and Internet infrastructures, which are the backbone of
the mobile revolution and are able to support the increasing demand for
data and connectivity combined with Cloud Computing infrastructures and
services</strong>.</p>
<p>Those infrastructures evolved a lot in the last 20 years, and they
are still evolving to support the new requirements of the mobile world
and as we will see in this course, the Internet of Things world.</p>
<p>Another interesting example is the event of the concert of Vasco
Rossi in Modena Park, July 2017, where more than 230K people attended
the event and almost all of them were using their mobile devices to
share the event in real time.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-wearable-computing">Mobile &amp; Wearable Computing</h3>
<p>Another interesting aspect of the mobile revolution is the rise of
wearable computing devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and

<p>Nowadays, we are not just associated to one or two mobile devices,
but we are surrounded by a plethora of connected devices that are
becoming an integral part of our daily lives. From smart home devices to
connected cars, the Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way we
interact with our environment and the world around us.</p>
<p>This devices creates a new paradigm where the physical and digital
worlds are increasingly interconnected, leading to new opportunities and
challenges in terms of connectivity, security, and data management.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-internet-of-things-iot-evolution-revolution">The Internet of
Things (IoT) Evolution &amp; Revolution</h1>
<p>In the context of the mobile revolution, the Internet of Things (IoT)
has emerged as a transformative concept that envisions a world where
everyday objects are connected to the internet, enabling them to collect
and exchange data. The IoT represents a significant evolution in the way
we interact with technology, as it extends connectivity beyond
traditional computing devices to encompass a wide range of physical
objects and environments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> refers to the idea of a
network of networks with billions of uniquely identified physical
devices denoted also as <strong>Smart Objects</strong> organized in an
<strong>Internet-like structure</strong>. Smart Objects are items such
as sensors, consumer devices, and enterprise assets that are
<strong>connected to both the Internet and each other</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Figure 1.8:</strong> IoT Pillars - Communication Technologies
(e.g., LoRa, NB-IoT), Hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino), Software
(e.g., C/C++, Python, Linux, RTOS) and Protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP)</p>
<p>One of the <strong>key characteristics of the Internet of Things
(IoT)</strong> is its reliance on the <strong>Internet</strong> itself.
The IoT is not simply about connecting devices; it is about connecting
them <strong>using standard Internet protocols</strong>, rather than
proprietary solutions. This approach is <strong>crucial for achieving
scalability, interoperability, and global accessibility</strong> in IoT
systems.</p>
<p>At the core of IoT connectivity is the <strong>Internet Protocol
(IP)</strong>, which provides a <strong>universal and standardized
method for devices to communicate and exchange data</strong> across
networks. Devices that join an IoT network are <strong>directly or
indirectly connected to an IP network</strong>, allowing them to be
<strong>addressed, managed, and integrated using standard IP-based
protocols</strong>. By leveraging <strong>IP as a common
protocol</strong>, IoT devices can not only communicate with each other,
but also <strong>connect seamlessly to the broader Internet and cloud
services</strong>. This enables <strong>new opportunities for data
storage, processing, and analysis</strong>, and supports the development
of <strong>innovative applications and services</strong> on a global
scale.</p>
<p>A key element to consider it that being connected to the Internet is
not mandatory for all the devices, but they must be able to communicate
using IP protocols, even if they are connected to a local network that
is not directly connected to the Internet. We can have IoT deployments
that are fully connected to the Internet, partially connected, or even
completely isolated from it, depending on the specific use case and
requirements. The common factor is that the devices must be able to
communicate using IP protocols, regardless of their connectivity to the
broader Internet.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Lecture1/iot_stack.png" alt="IoT Stack" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">IoT Stack</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Figure 1.9:</strong> IoT Protocol Stack vs Traditional
Networking Stack</p>
<p>IoT device cannot always use the traditional Internet protocol stack
due to their <strong>resource constraints</strong> (e.g., limited
processing power, memory, and energy). For this reason, IoT devices
often use <strong>lightweight protocols</strong> that are specifically
designed for resource-constrained environments. These protocols are
optimized for low power consumption, reduced bandwidth usage, and
efficient data transmission.</p>
<p>For example, two widely adopted protocols in IoT applications are
<strong>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)</strong> and
<strong>CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MQTT</strong> is a lightweight, publish-subscribe
messaging protocol designed for efficient communication between devices
with limited bandwidth and resources. It is commonly used for telemetry
and remote monitoring in IoT scenarios. MQTT can be compared to
traditional enterprise messaging protocols such as <strong>AMQP
(Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)</strong>, as both support the
publish-subscribe paradigm, but MQTT is optimized for constrained
environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CoAP</strong> is a specialized web transfer protocol
designed for use with resource-constrained devices and networks. It
follows a request/response model similar to <strong>HTTP (Hypertext
Transfer Protocol)</strong>, but is much more lightweight, making it
suitable for IoT deployments where minimizing overhead is
critical.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These protocols are specifically engineered to be lightweight and
efficient, addressing the limitations of IoT devices in terms of
processing power, memory, and energy consumption. In contrast,
traditional protocols like HTTP and <strong>TCP (Transmission Control
Protocol)</strong> are more resource-intensive and may not be practical
for all IoT scenarios.</p>
<p>The <strong>adoption of standard Internet protocols</strong>—such as
<strong>IP, TCP, UDP, and HTTP</strong>—along with the use of
<strong>lightweight alternatives</strong> like <strong>MQTT</strong> and
<strong>CoAP</strong>, is <strong>essential</strong> for the successful
implementation and widespread adoption of IoT systems. By leveraging
these protocols, <strong>IoT devices can achieve seamless connectivity,
interoperability, and scalability</strong>, enabling a wide range of
applications and services that enhance our daily lives and transform
various industries.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>smart home devices</strong> (e.g., thermostats,
lights, and security cameras) use standard protocols to communicate with
mobile apps and cloud platforms, allowing users to monitor and control
their homes remotely. In <strong>industrial IoT</strong>, sensors and
machines use MQTT to transmit telemetry data to centralized dashboards
for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. <strong>Healthcare
wearables</strong> leverage CoAP to efficiently send patient data to
hospital systems for continuous health tracking.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of <strong>standard Internet protocols
facilitates the integration of IoT devices with existing IT
infrastructure and cloud services</strong>, enabling new opportunities
for <strong>data analytics, machine learning, and artificial
intelligence</strong>. For instance, IoT sensors in agriculture can use
lightweight protocols like MQTT to efficiently transmit environmental
data—such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity—to cloud-based
analytics platforms. MQTT optimizes communication between
resource-constrained devices and the cloud by enabling reliable,
low-bandwidth data transfer. Once collected, this data can be exposed
via HTTP APIs, making it accessible to traditional applications such as
dashboards for real-time monitoring or AI models for advanced analytics.
This seamless integration of IoT protocols and standard web technologies
enables organizations to build smarter, more responsive, and data-driven
solutions across domains.</p>

<h1 id="cyberphysical-systems">Cyber–Physical Systems</h1>
<p>In this context, <strong>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)</strong> play a
crucial role in bridging the gap between the physical and digital
worlds. CPS are systems that integrate computation, networking, and
physical processes to enable real-time monitoring, control, and
interaction with the physical environment.</p>
<p><em>A <strong>Cyber-Physical System (CPS)</strong> refers to
integrated systems that combine computational elements with physical
components, enabling the interaction and collaboration between the
digital and physical worlds. CPS typically involve a network of
<strong>sensors</strong>, <strong>actuators</strong>, and
<strong>computational devices</strong> that <strong>collect
data</strong> from the physical environment, <strong>process</strong>
it, and <strong>control</strong> physical processes or objects.</em></p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Typically, CPS are characterized by the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration of Physical and Cyber Components</strong>: CPS
seamlessly integrate physical components (sensors, actuators, etc.) with
cyber components (computers, networks, software) to enable real-time
monitoring and control of physical processes.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Interaction</strong>: CPS are designed to operate
in real-time, allowing for immediate response to changes in the physical
environment and enabling dynamic interactions between the physical and
digital worlds.</li>
<li><strong>Networked Communication</strong>: CPS rely on networked
communication to facilitate data exchange and coordination between
distributed components, enabling collaboration and coordination across
different physical locations.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomy and Adaptability</strong>: CPS often incorporate
autonomous decision-making capabilities, allowing them to adapt to
changing conditions and optimize performance based on real-time
data.</li>
<li><strong>Safety and Reliability</strong>: CPS are often deployed in
safety-critical applications, requiring robust safety and reliability
measures to ensure the integrity and security of both physical and cyber
components.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/Lecture1/cps_phases.png"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As illustrated in the figure above, CPS typically involve the
following phases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Perceive</strong>: In this phase, sensors collect data from
the physical environment, such as temperature, pressure, or motion.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>: The collected data is then processed and
analyzed using computational algorithms to extract meaningful insights
and patterns. This phase can be further broken down into sub-phases:
<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong>: The collected data is then processed and
analyzed using computational algorithms to extract meaningful insights
and patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Learn</strong>: Learning techniques may be applied to enable
the system to learn from historical data and improve its performance
over time.</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>: Based on the analysis and learning, the
system can plan actions or responses to be taken in the physical
environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Act</strong>: Finally, actuators are used to execute the
planned actions, such as adjusting a thermostat, controlling a robotic
arm, or activating an alarm.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After the action phase, the cycle continues
with the system continuously perceiving, analyzing, learning, planning,
and acting in a dynamic and adaptive manner.</p>

<h3 id="cps-software-as-distributed-software">CPS Software as
Distributed Software</h3>
<p>One of the main characteristics of CPS is that each component is
characterized by its own software module that is responsible for the
management of the component itself. When multiple components are
integrated into a CPS, the software modules of each component need to
interact and communicate with each other to enable the overall
functionality of the system and we start talking about
<strong>Distributed Systems</strong> and <strong>Distributed
Software</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Lecture1/cps_distributed_software.png"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">CPS Distributed Software</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some of the main challenges and characteristics of CPS software
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration of Physical and Digital Components:</strong> CPS
involves the integration of software systems with physical components
such as sensors, actuators, and control systems. The software must
interact with these physical elements to monitor and control the
underlying physical processes.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time and Predictability:</strong> CPS often operates in
real-time or near-real-time environments where timely and predictable
responses are critical. The software must be designed to meet stringent
timing requirements, ensuring timely data collection, processing, and
control actions.</li>
<li><strong>Heterogeneity and Interoperability:</strong> CPS typically
involve a mix of diverse technologies, devices, and communication
protocols. The software must be capable of interacting and integrating
with different hardware and software components, ensuring
interoperability and seamless communication among them.</li>
<li><strong>Safety and Reliability:</strong> CPS are often deployed in
safety-critical domains such as automotive, healthcare, and industrial
automation. The software must be developed with a strong emphasis on
safety and reliability, adhering to rigorous standards and employing
techniques like fault tolerance and error handling.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability and Adaptability:</strong> CPS are often
deployed in large-scale systems where the number of connected devices
and data volumes can be substantial. The software must be scalable,
capable of handling increasing system complexity and data loads.
Additionally, it should be adaptable to dynamic changes in the
environment or system requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Network and Connectivity:</strong> CPS software must utilize
the network connectivity for communication between the cyber and
physical world, as well as among different CPS components. For example,
a smart grid system must coordinate the power generation and
distribution among different sources and consumers through the
internet.</li>
<li><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong> CPS are vulnerable to
cybersecurity threats due to their interconnected nature. The software
must incorporate robust security measures to protect against potential
attacks and ensure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong>Verification and Validation:</strong> Due to the critical
nature of CPS, software development for CPS requires thorough
verification and validation processes. Rigorous testing, simulation, and
formal methods are employed to ensure the correctness, performance, and
safety of the software.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we escalate to the more general Cyber-Physical System models, the
design and control challenges become even harder, since individual
component autonomy must be glued by explicitly addressing
interdependence and coordination, interoperability, distributed control
and emergence of behaviors. In this context centralized and static
management and control model are not expected to be the right solution
approach to address all these challenges and the current main existing
issues are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized</strong> and <strong>monolithic</strong>
Software architectures</li>
<li>Missing management of the <strong>massive heterogeneity</strong> and
<strong>fragmentation</strong> of the physical layer (protocols,
software, hardware, data format, etc …)</li>
<li><strong>Limited interoperability</strong> and collaboration both
between existing solutions and through cross-domain application
scenarios</li>
<li><strong>Centralized learning</strong> and coordination</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, the envisioned goal is to build a new generation
of distributed, highly-dynamic, opportunistic, able to operate in an
open and coordinated environment through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>distributed</strong> and <strong>continuum</strong>
architectures (across device, edge, cloud)</li>
<li><strong>networking</strong> and <strong>intelligent
communication</strong></li>
<li><strong>effective management</strong> of the physical layer
heterogeneity</li>
<li><strong>standardization</strong> and <strong>native
interoperability</strong></li>
<li><strong>control</strong>, <strong>supervision</strong> and
<strong>management</strong></li>
<li><strong>local coordination</strong></li>
<li><strong>autonomy</strong> of the sub-systems</li>
<li><strong>native system re-configuration</strong></li>
<li><strong>decentralized learning</strong> &amp; <strong>dynamic
evolution</strong> and <strong>behaviors</strong></li>
</ul>

CPSoS (Cyber-Physical System of Systems)</h2>

<p>The concept of <strong>Cyber-Physical System of Systems
(CPSoS)</strong> refers to the <strong>integration</strong> and
<strong>collaboration</strong> of multiple, interconnected
<strong>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)</strong> to form a more complex
and sophisticated system. In a CPSoS, each individual CPS maintains its
<strong>autonomy</strong> and <strong>functionality</strong>, yet
participates in <strong>coordinated interaction</strong> and
<strong>networked communication</strong> with other CPS units to achieve
shared objectives.</p>
<p>A <strong>CPSoS</strong> is characterized by: - <strong>Distributed
Coordination:</strong> Multiple CPS units interact and cooperate,
leveraging their individual capabilities to address system-wide goals. -
<strong>Autonomous Components:</strong> Each CPS unit operates
independently, with its own physical components, computational
resources, and control logic. - <strong>Scalability and
Complexity:</strong> CPSoS can range from small, localized
collaborations to vast, large-scale networks of CPS units. -
<strong>Enhanced System Intelligence:</strong> By combining the
strengths and resources of diverse CPS units, CPSoS enables improved
<strong>performance</strong>, <strong>efficiency</strong>, and
<strong>adaptability</strong> beyond what isolated systems can achieve.
- <strong>Resilience and Flexibility:</strong> The distributed nature of
CPSoS fosters greater <strong>system-wide resilience</strong>, allowing
for dynamic adaptation and robust operation even in the face of failures
or changing environments.</p>
<p>The key idea behind <strong>CPSoS</strong> is to create a
<strong>synergistic network</strong> where the <strong>collective
intelligence</strong> and <strong>resources</strong> of multiple CPS
units result in superior functionality, adaptability, and reliability,
paving the way for advanced applications in domains such as smart
cities, industrial automation, healthcare, and transportation.</p>
<p>CPSoS are increasingly prevalent across diverse domains, including
smart cities, transportation, industrial automation, and healthcare.
<strong>Key examples</strong> of CPSoS include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interconnected traffic management systems</strong> that
coordinate signals and monitor flows across a city</li>
<li><strong>Coordinated smart grid networks</strong> integrating
distributed energy resources for efficient power management</li>
<li><strong>Integrated healthcare monitoring systems</strong> enabling
real-time patient data sharing across facilities</li>
<li><strong>Smart manufacturing environments</strong> where multiple
production lines and robots collaborate seamlessly</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, managing CPSoS introduces significant challenges such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Achieving seamless communication
and data exchange between heterogeneous CPS units</li>
<li><strong>Heterogeneity:</strong> Integrating systems with diverse
architectures, protocols, and technologies</li>
<li><strong>Scalability and Complexity:</strong> Coordinating large
numbers of autonomous CPS units while maintaining system
performance</li>
<li><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong> Protecting sensitive data and
ensuring robust operation across interconnected systems</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, CPSoS represent a higher-level integration of multiple
CPS units, enabling collaborative and coordinated operation. This
approach unlocks advanced functionalities, improved performance, and
increased system intelligence, but requires addressing interoperability,
scalability, and security challenges.</p>
